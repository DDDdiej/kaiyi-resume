<h1>Personal Profile</h1>

<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Just after my 14th birthday, I set out on a new journey to study in Canada. 
  Leaving the place I was familiar with and moving to a completely new country was a huge challenge for me. 
  My first stop in Canada was Winnipeg, where I spent four unforgettable years. 
  I made many close friends there, and the city became filled with so many memories of joy, sadness, 
  and growth that I now consider it my second hometown.</p>

<p>After graduation, I moved to Edmonton. At first, I resisted the change, 
  because it meant leaving behind what I knew and starting from zero again in a new city. 
  But as I gradually opened up to Edmonton, met new friends at university, 
  and got involved in community activities and volunteer work, 
  I realized that life could still be just as wonderful. These experiences shaped me into someone with 
  strong adaptability and resilience, and they continue to fuel my passion for life.</p>

<p>Outside of academics, I enjoy fishing, cycling, and running, which help me stay active and disciplined. 
  Baking is another passion of mine—I love trying new recipes and sharing desserts with friends. Baking also allows me to be creative, 
  and I can have my own style of baking.
  I also spend time with pets, listen to music, and reading, all of which keep me curious and balanced. </p>

    <p>Cycling is one of my favorite ways to stay active and clear my mind. Exploring new routes makes me feel free and energized. And every time you pedal, it pushes you a little bit closer to your destination.</p>
